# Front-End

App Description:
This app's purpose is to bring people together when it comes to fitness and make the fitness experience easier and less intimidating for all parties. A) For instructors it is meant to help them set up their own classes and stimulate their income by conducting fitness classes wherever and whenever. B) For those who have always wanted to get fit but are intimidated by big gyms or for those who want a more communal training experience. You can sign up for classes with your friends or find new friends by joining classes and having new experiences. 

Instructors can either be certified or non certified, allowing more flexibility to the fitness experience. It can be a hobby or a full time job. 

Those who are looking for fitness can either be fitness experts, or those just wanting to lose a couple pounds.
